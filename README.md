# The Haunted House 
This is a website I have made as a assignment in the 4th semester. This is a based on Haunted Game where the user will be given some situations and he will revert on those situations. If his answer is correct he will move to the next part otherwise he will get stuck here for forever.
This is the website I have made as a project for my Course in the 5th semester. This is a website related to halloween.
This website can be acccessed by [Clicking Here](https://aakashdeepwahi.github.io/TheHauntedHouse/). So that you guys can enjoy our spooky theme. Here is a quiz that you can access in it with some dangerous sound. I request that heart patients please lower the volume while playing. One can play this quiz game over the phone, laptop and tablet.


## Installation
Download the file unzip them if they are zipped or in the folder. Just look for index.html file it will run in the chrome automatically no extra efforts are required.
It doesn't need any application to be installed in that.

## Some Basic Information
This is basically a game based on a boy named as Sal. User is playing his character. He jumped into a mansion where he have to take care of himself and be safe from the ghosts as well. 

## Beware
There are some annoying sounds with every question. Keep the volume a little bit low otherwise it will affect you.

# Who can Contribute 
I have completed everything and believe that no changes are required to play the game but stil pull and push both the requests are welcomes and issue raisal is also appreciated. I think so I have chosen this as being a geek and a developer we all know that changes are required to make the technology better thats the reason everyone prefers open source. If someone wants to improve it or make some more pages in it. It will be highly appreciated.
